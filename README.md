Testing:
  * Unit tests: I have been working with Jest with a eslint config enforcing good practices.

  * Functional tests: Testing Library! I just love it, it ensures the developpers maintain accessibility, it's fast and solid.
  I Like to write custom functions to easy the tests of repetitive tasks with components.

  * E2E:
    * React Native: I have not yet had the chance to try it on React native projects but I am looking forward to use Detox.
    * React Web: I have used:
      * Cypress
      * TestCafe
      * Playwright / QAWolf < Love it.

# React/React Native:
  * I have written my own validation form library named useForm (Not open source yet, it's yup library based but the open source version will use Zod (typescript FTW!) validation engine)
  * I am fluent with hooks, I love to keep my code DRY and explicit

# React native:
  I have been working with:
  * maps
  * cookie httpOnly secure cookies base authentication / JWT
  * Firebase for push notifications
  * chat (graphql subscription based messages)
  * payment:
    * Stripe
    * iOS payment
    * Android payment
  * Animations: I have used both the react native animations systems and React Native Reanimated libraries.
  * Svg homemade charts. No library except for d3 interpolation functions
  * I have suffered so much with XCode blurry errors that I can work out common errors soon enough.

  * I have architectured every react native apps I have been working for with:
    * Fastlane fully automatised CI deployment with:
      * Appcenter
      * TestFlight
      * Android test lanes
    * Licences management with Fastlane and encryption/decryption on CI environments.
  * I live and breath with docker and docker-compose, I can write my own images.
  * Docker-compose traefik with https on development environments are a must have IMO.
